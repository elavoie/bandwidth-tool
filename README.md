# bandwidth-tool
Wu-Wei wrapper for the bandwidth benchmark (http://zsmith.co/bandwidth.html), which measures the speed of the memory hierarchy. Adds the bandwidth information to the platform information for use by other tools, which may for example compare the bandwidth used in a current benchark to the maximum bandwidth available on the platform.
